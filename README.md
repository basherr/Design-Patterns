# Contribution-Guides
Your contribution may have a very good impact on the community thus try sharing every possible example that you can either think of or had experienced in the past.

The repository is not based on any framework but rather inspired by [No Framework](https://github.com/PatrickLouys/no-framework-tutorial)

The code structure for the repository is as follows:
- `app`
- `bootstraps`
- `public`
- `stubs`
- `tests`

The life cycle of the application is as follows:

- `public/index.php` serves as the entry point for the entire application which loads `boostrap/autoload.php`
- `bootstrap/autoload.php` processes `HTTP` request and forwards the route to the relevant `Controller method` defined in `bootstrap/routes.php`. 

In order to contribute and add real world example for the related pattern, please follow the guidelines:
- Fork the repository
- Create a folder inside `app/Patterns/{Type e.g Creational, Behavioral or Structural}/{Pattern Name}/{Example Name}/your code`
- Please create a READMe.md and include a UML diagram. [Example README.md](https://github.com/basherr/PHP-Design-Patterns/tree/master/app/Patterns/Creational/AbstractPattern/TvManufacturer)
- Add `unit tests`
- Create `Application.php` with a method named `render` to describe the usage. [Example Application.php](https://github.com/basherr/PHP-Design-Patterns/blob/master/app/Patterns/Creational/AbstractPattern/TvManufacturer/Application.php)
- Add a method in the relevant controller(e.g creational) and add a route in `bootstraps/routes.php`
- Please run `composer test` and make sure all tests are passing
- Create a PR against the master branch

Please feel free to contribute and create pull requests.
